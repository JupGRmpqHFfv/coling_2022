In this repo, we publish our code and datasets of experiments in the paper: A Neural Approach for Automatic Student Performance Judgment with Classroom Dialogue

We use BERT code from [this work](https://github.com/GeorgeLuImmortal/Hierarchical-BERT-Model-with-Limited-Labelled-Data)


## DataSet 

We publish the datasets of our experiments. The dataset contains the raw teacher's and student's conversations in each example question. And also contain the data after preprocessing, which can be straight used to train models.

The datasets can download from [this url](https://www.dropbox.com/s/6941wjt6aragodx/data.zip?dl=0), after downloading the data put the data in `data` folder. The folder structure is following:

`data`
- `dataset`
- `features`
- `word2vec`
- `README.md`

The dataset description can see in [there](data/README.md)

## Codes

We will release codes after the paper published.
